#### This is a collection of custom binary/shell scripts that I use to make NOC/sysadmin work a little faster. ###

You can place them in /bin (or /usr/local/bin in macOS) like I do or place in your /home/%username% dir and save .sh file extensions on them.

Enjoy! :)

  Colored output may not work properly on macOS.
  Correcting color syntax may correct this issue.
