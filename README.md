#### This is a collection of custom binary/shell scripts that I use to make NOC/SysAdmin work a little faster.

You can place them in /bin (or /usr/local/bin in macOS) like I do or place in your user directory and save .sh file extensions on them.

Enjoy! :)

  Colored output may not work properly on some terminal emulators.
